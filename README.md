This code is a thin command-line wrapper over the [AudioMoth-Utils node library by OpenAcousticDevices](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/AudioMoth-Utils).

## Installation

Install the CLI by downloading the appropriate binary for your operating system from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/audiomoth-utils-cli/releases).

Neither JavaScript experience nor Node.js is required to use this tool.

## Usage

To see the available commands and options:


```bash
$ audiomoth-utils --help
```

This will display the full usage information and available options.

## Features

Currently, the CLI supports a subset of the functionality provided by the upstream AudioMoth-Utils node library.
We aspire to gradually ramp up to provide full coverage in future releases.
